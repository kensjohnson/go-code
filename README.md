moved the go-code directory up a level to see if it helps with the go build command form the command view.  it didnt, but go install will install hello.exe in the \pkg directory. not sure what the issue with go build is. possiblye a module issue

addeed hello.go, did a build, and worked fine

created a folder named hello in the go-code folder
